Sometimes you have a channel with a peer and you really don't want to have that channel with them anymore - maybe because they are flaky about connectivity or whatever, and they are offline when you decide you want to be done with them.  You don't *totally* hate the situation, so you don't want to force close the channel, but you just want to close the channel next time they come online.  This plugin is for you.
